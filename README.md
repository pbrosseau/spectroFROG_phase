Convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to conduct multivariate regression and map frequency resolved optical gating (FROG) spectrograms onto the phase
of the corresponding pulse.

The jupyter notebook "spectroFROG_benchmark.ipynb" shows an example of the phase retrieval process using prepared training data.

A more thorough description of how the procedure works is given on my personal website:
